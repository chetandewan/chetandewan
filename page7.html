			From movies to games to simulation systems, the power of 3D computer 
			graphics has increased tremendously over the last decade . Computer 
			graphics can be used for visual simulations to improve perception of 
			soldier thus imparting effective training. Creating these customised 
			video games requires tremendous programming skills as also an 
			advanced simulation system. </font></span></li>
			<li>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
			<font face="Arial" size="2">The objective of the project being 
			undertaken is to decide the essential and desirable (wish list) 
			features that we would want as part of a 3D rendering engine 
			suitable for military simulation and then carry out a survey of the 
			many freeware game engines available on the Internet. Based on our 
			survey we would then try to customize this engine to our 
			requirements’ and finally test our project with a sample simulation.

			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
			<font face="Arial"><font size="2">Commercial off the shelf 
			simulation systems </font><span lang="EN-IN"><font size="2">are 
			priced heavily and applications built on them require runtime 
			licenses costing up to six figures for each application built. 
			However, in reality, a review of some of these simulations reveals 
			that almost all of them have essentially the same features; probably 
			90% of the functionality each provides is basically the same as that 
			of a game, with minor differences. The difference between all of 
			them essentially boils down to the most advanced features each 
			provides. However, these advanced features are not needed for the 
			vast majority of simulations. Worse, once these systems are used, 
			projects become locked into the proprietary technologies used as the 
			code is written expressly for the proprietary engine. In case you 
			want a modified application due to changing requirements, you have 
			to go back to the vendor for an upgrade as no source code is 
			available.</font></span></font></li>
			<li>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
			<font face="Arial" size="2">I decided to start our quest for open 
			source projects from Source Forge and other such Internet sites as a 
			starting place to look for basic rendering engines and add-on 
			modules to add to our open source engine. Our selection would be 
			based on our credo and the following two criteria: </font></li>

		<ul type="square">
			<li><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;Project’s technical background and merits.</font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;User

		<ol start="5">
			<li>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
			<font face="Arial" size="2">The rationale for choosing projects upon 
			their technical background and merits would help in effective 
			integration with minimum problems to the main solution while a 
			project’s user support base and popularity would ensure that these 
			projects don’t stagnate (ie remain current) too soon as they have 
			many “indirect” developers. </font></li>
		</ol>
		<ol start="6">
			<li>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
			<font face="Arial" size="2">My endeavour is to customise a prebuilt 
			base engine to have almost all the desirable features in a fixed 
			time frame. The desirable modules will be added from open source 
			projects using the popular hooks method available as part of any 
			object oriented programming. I intend to use VC ++.NET.</font></li>
