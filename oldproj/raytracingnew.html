<h2>Ray Tracing Assignment </h2>
</div>
<br>
The aim of the assignment was to generate interesting images using
POVRAY - Persistence of Vision Raytracer .So,
it entailed studying and implementing various features of POV-Ray. The
features used in the images are:-<br>
<ol>
  <li>Using the .ini method</li>
  <li>Placing camera/ Multiple cameras were also tried<br>
  </li>
  <li>heading, pitch , roll and FOV for Objects</li>
  <li>Light sources</li>
  <li>Various texture options</li>
  <li>Internal animation<br>
  </li>
  <li>Using mesh data</li>
	<li>Format conversion using existing 3D models</li>
</ol>
The emphasis has been on the lighting effects in the picture. Animation
has been used extensively to generate different frames of the image.
These frames have been integrated into an <a href="file:///raytracingnew_files/cd.gif">animated
GIF file using</a><a href="file:///raytracingnew_files/air.htm">ULEAD GIF ANIMATOR </a>on Linux Platform. First, let us have a look at
the still images obtained by the program. The following image(without the clock 
object) has been rendered&nbsp; (No animation).<br>

<div style="text-align: center;">
	<img src="raytracingnew_files/prowler_POV_scene0.jpg" border="0" height="384" width="512"><br>
</div>
<br>
<div style="text-align: left;">As can be seen later, changing just one
parameter in the fov OF&nbsp; .pov file, we can get significant change in the 
	background. <br>

	<img src="raytracingnew_files/prowler_POV_scene1.jpg" border="0" height="384" width="512"><br>
</div>
<br>
<div style="text-align: left;">A simple animation is created using the
"clock" variable. The PLANE zooms past the screen as the animation advances. The 
	water is also animated A 3D model was used to generate this image some more 
	on how it was done is appended below<p>1.I used the Open flight API&#8217;s and 
	Multigen creators capabilities to convert the Prowler.flt to Prowler.dxf 
	format. After that I used a freeware converter toolkit called Poseray 
	Moraywin to convert this into a Povray mesh. The geometry, texture and 
	material include files were created which were include in an .ini file. This 
	file was included in a base file for Povray.<br>
	2. I then added various include files as required. I then initialised the 
	light source by trial and error at a sufficient distance. I wanted it to act 
	like a sunlight but since the effect was not too good changed the values 
	later to suit the scene. I used the sky.inc file from samples included. I 
	then defined the ocean using chrome texture and glass texture. I then used 
	poserays self generated camera and light source attached with camera to 
	modify my scene. The geometry file was included to produce the airplane.<br>
	3. Lots of sample images included.Lots of permutations and combinations 
	tried including animation with clockmod.inc.</p>

Resources used:<br>
There is a lot of material available on the web. However, the best
place to go to learn POV-Ray from scratch would be <a href="http://www.povray.org/documentation/">http://www.povray.org/documentation/</a>.
There are many other websites which display amazing creations. Some of
them are mentioned below.<br>
